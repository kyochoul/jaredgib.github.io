<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Welcome to my repository!&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p>This will be used to provide resources related to Thunkable and ReactJS/CodeAcademy</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jaredgib/jaredgib.github.io/tree/master/Charts">Thunkable</a>:</strong></p>
<p>Thunkable just added the ability to interact with web pages which makes the platform even stronger for someone learning JS or other web-based languages! This was previously possible through the use of API POST/GET calls but now is possible with HTTPS POST as well, and it is super easy to do so!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you will add in the code from <a href="https://github.com/thunkable/webviewer-extension/blob/master/README.md" title="Thunkable Web Viewer Extensions">Thunkable</a> at the end of your Javascript and between your head tags. It adds a listener event that can fire javascript, allowing you to inject user/app-specific data to the page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first use case is for charting. previously, a Thunker would have had to use Quickchart.io to produce a static chart image. These were nice, but boring. Now, Thunkers can use a webviewer component and customized chart files stored here on Github!</p>

<p>I am working through the ReactJS tutorials on CodeAcademy. I will be posting snippets that I work on which I am excited about or proud of. They are simple but my Journey into JS is only about 10 days old (as of 4/24/20).&nbsp;</p>
