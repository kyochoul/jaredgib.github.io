<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Welcome to my repository!&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p>This will be used to provide resources related to Thunkable and ReactJS/CodeAcademy</p>

<p>Thunkable just added the ability to interact with web pages which makes the platform even stronger for someone
  learning JS or other web-based languages! This was previously possible through the use of API POST/GET calls but now
  is possible with HTTPS POST as well, and it is super easy to do so!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you will add in the code from <a
    href="https://github.com/thunkable/webviewer-extension/blob/master/README.md"
    title="Thunkable Web Viewer Extensions">Thunkable</a> at the end of your Javascript and between your head tags. It
  adds a listener event that can fire javascript, allowing you to inject user/app-specific data to the page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first use case is for charting. previously, a Thunker would have had to use Quickchart.io to produce a static
  chart image. They were nice but boring. Now, Thunkers can use a web viewer component and customized chart files stored
  here on Github!</p>

</p>
<p>I am working through the ReactJS tutorials on CodeAcademy. I will be posting snippets that I work on which I am
  excited about or proud of. They are simple but my Journey into JS is only about 10 days old (as of 4/24/20).&nbsp;</p>
